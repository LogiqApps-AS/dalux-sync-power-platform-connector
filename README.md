# ðŸŒŸ Dalux Sync Power Platform Connector
Welcome to the Dalux Sync Power Platform Connector! This project includes a Dataverse solution featuring a custom connector component representing `Dalux API v.4.7`.

# ðŸš€ How to Build a New Release
Follow these steps to manually create a new release on GitHub:

1. Create a New Tag
Use the naming convention `v.x.x.x`, where `x` is a digit. For example: `v.0.9.1`.

The final version of the solution will be `v.0.9.1.buildNumber`, where buildNumber corresponds to `github.run_number`.
# ðŸ“¦ Artifacts
The artifact name is automatically derived from `package/Other/Solution.xml` -> `UniqueName`.
The release will include both `managed` and `unmanaged` solutions.
